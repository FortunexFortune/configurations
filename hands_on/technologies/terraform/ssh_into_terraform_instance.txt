How do I login to an AWS ec2 instance which is created 
by a terraform script?


Terraform is only a way to deploy your infrastructure. The functionality depends
 on the components you have deployed. So it depends on the type of OS you have 
selected while creating the instance.

Assuming you have defined a key pair in your terraform script, 
below are the username for each distribution using which you can connect to the instance:

Amazon Linux: ec2-user

Ubuntu: ubuntu

Debian: admin

RHEL 6.4 and later: ec2-user

Windows: Administrator (Password has to be decrpyt from the console using pem file)
