 ----------------------PIPPES and INPUT to OUTPUT riderection----------------------------

===========================================================
	
Any process that runs on the linux kernel as 3 CHANNELS called:

STDIN -->0		 /*Your Standard keyboard input*/ 
STDOUT -->1		 /*Your Standard terminal output*/ 
STDERR -->2		/*Your Standard terminal Error message*/ 
===========================================================

STDOUT -->1		 /*Your Standard terminal output*/ 

echo "this should be in a file " 1>file.txt
echo "this should be in a file " >file.txt

/*We are creating a string that is been feed into a new file*/ 
/*The bad thing about this is that if the file is existing it will overwrite the content*/
/*We are creating a string that is been feed into a new file, works without the 1 too*/ 


echo "this should be in a file " 1>>file.txt
echo "this should be in a file " >>file.txt
/*the double >> will not overwirte the file, it will create
 a new line and start inputing from a new line*/


STDERR -->2		/*Your Standard terminal Error message*/ 
/*Here is an example of how to feed an error ouput into a file:*/

sadfsfbdsflkdsyf 2> err.txt
/*Insert any error line that you will find as an error message
 to a file, the number 2 is the important bit*/ 

sadfsfbdsflkdsyf 2>> err.txt

===========================================================
Pippes= this allow you to filtering, sorting, FUnneling input to output
data  [PRO1 | PRO2]
	
===========================================================
prog | Prog2 | prog3
/*Feeds the output of each comand or program into the next program*/

Prog && Prog 2
/*if prog is sucesfull then prog 2 will runs also*/

ls hello.txt && echo "hello file worked."
/*if comand hello.txt runs, then run echo*/
/*if comand hello.txt does not exist runs, then run echo will not run*/



----------------------Installing and updating----------------------------
/*APT (Advanced Package Tool) is the command line tool to interact with this 
packaging system. There is already dpkg commands to manage it. But apt is more 
friendly way to handle packaging. You can use it to find and install new packages,
 upgrade packages, clean the packages etc.*/

 /*There are two main tool around it: apt-get and apt-cache. apt-get is for installing, 
 upgrading and cleaning packages while apt-cache is used for finding new packages.
  We’ll see all these commands with examples later in this guide.*/

  /*https://itsfoss.com/apt-get-linux-guide/*/

sudo apt-get update

/*doesn't actually install new versions of software. Instead, it updates 
the package lists for upgrades for packages that need upgrading, as well
 as new packages that have just come to the repositories.*/

sudo apt-get upgrade

/* will upgrade programss int the mcahine */

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y

/*the fastest and the most convenient way to update your system is to use this command:*/

apt-get dist-upgrade

/*The command apt-get dist-upgrade, on the other hand, is proactive. 
It looks for dependencies with the newer version of the package being 
installed and it tries to install a new package or remove an existing one on its own.*/

apt-cache search software

/*This command will look for the specific item selected */

apt-cache showpkg <package_name>

/*Once you know the exact package name, you can get more information about it such as version,
 dependencies etc by using the command above:*/

 sudo apt-get install software
/*This command will install for the specific item selected */

sudo apt-get install software opera notpad+
/*This command will install multiple softwares at the same time */

sudo apt-get remove software
/*This command will remove for the specific item selected */

sudo apt-get upgrade software

/*To upgrade only a specific program:*/

sudo apt-get install <package_name> --no-upgrade

/* install packages without upgrading*/

sudo apt-get install <package_name> --only-upgrade

/*It upgrade packages, not install it*/

sudo apt-get install <package_name>=<version_number>

/*it install a specific version of an application*/

sudo apt-get remove <package_name>

/*It removes installed packages with apt-get*/
/*apt-get remove just removes the binaries of a package. It doesn’t touch the configuration files*/

sudo apt-get purge <package_name>

/*apt-get purge removes everything related to a package including the configuration files*/
/*Purge is particularly useful when you have messed up with the configuration of a program. You want to completely erase its traces from the system and perhaps start afresh.*/

sudo apt-get clean

/*o clean the local repository of retrieved package files*/

sudo apt-get autoclean

/* autoclean only removes those retrieved package files that have a newer version now and they won’t be used anymore.*/

sudo apt-get autoremove

/* It removes libs and packages that were installed automatically to satisfy 
the dependencies of an installed package. If the package is removed, these
 automatically installed packages are useless in the system. */

/*Not all software are avaible in your reposatory, in such case you have to 
install the reposatory of the software you are instrested in(Make sure its safe)*/

_____________________________________
Changing Permissions Easy Fast Method

chmod

/*
4  == Stands for "read"
2  == Stands for "write"
1  == Stands for "execute"
0  == Stand for "No permissions"

7 == is the combination of all the numbers "Read Write Execute"
6 == is the combination of 4 and 2 "Read and Write"
5 == is the combination of 4 and 1 "Read and execute"
3 == is the combination of 2 and 1 "Write and Execute"
*/

chmod 777 file

/*This would be the least secure as you give everyone all permissions*/

_____________SSH_______________________
/*


SSH, also known as Secure Socket Shell, is a network protocol that provides administrators with a secure way to access a remote computer. SSH also refers to the suite of utilities that implement the protocol. Secure Shell provides strong authentication and secure encrypted data communications between two computers connecting over an insecure network such as the Internet. SSH is widely used by network administrators for managing systems and applications remotely, allowing them to log in to another computer over a network, execute commands and move files from one computer to another.


*/


/* SSH connection */
/* SSH username@ip_adress*/
ssh pi@10.42.0.90


_____________SSH_Keys_______________________
 
/*Unfortunately password authentications are not secure at all, 
this are usually hacked all the time by peole over the internet

A good alternative is using ssh keys, 2 keys

1) Private key  --> stays on your personal computer

2)Public key   --> stays on local  computer

*/

/*
The great benefits of the keys are the secure connections
and the fact you o not need to insert the password anything 
you log into your server.S


*/

1)
 ssh-keygen -t rsa

/* configuration*/
/*this will generate the 2 keys

Your identification has been saved in /home/fortune/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/fortune/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
*/


2) 
 ssh-copy-id pi@10.25.6.0

/*Copies the public key to the server (local computer)*/
