=================== Procesess =================== 
ps aux  | grep -i process

ps -ef  | grep -i process	# To see every process on the system using standard syntax

				PID - The process ID. Usually,
				TTY - The name of the controlling terminal for the process.
				TIME - The cumulative CPU time of the process, shown in minutes and seconds.
				CMD - The name of the command that was used to start the process.
				
				
				TIME is a measure of actual CPU time being used, 
				not elapsed time since the process started. 
				If the process is essentially idle, TIME will not increment much

================== Rsync ===================
You may have noticed that there is a trailing slash (/) at the end of the first argument in the below commands:
This is necessary to mean “the contents of dir1”. The alternative, without the trailing slash, would place dir1, including the directory, within dir2.

rsync -a dir1/ dir2 		 # -a -> It stands for “archive” and 
				 syncs recursively
				 preserves symbolic links
				 special and device 
				 files
				 modification times
				 group
				 owner
				 permissions.




rsync -anvP --delete  /mnt/SDS_data/ /mnt/SDS_data_small/			# sync data (copy) 
rsync -anv dir1/ dir2
rsync -a --include='*.sql' --exclude='*' /home/ubuntu/dir/  <hostName>@<ip>:/tmp/ 	# Rsync over ssh, rsync specific files

-n or –dry-run					# Dry run
-v 						# versbose


rsync -a --exclude '.git'  ~/git/kds_scripts/ /tmp/serv4eo-processing/					# sync data but exclude a specific file or folder 
rsync -a --exclude 'file1.txt' --exclude 'dir1/*' --exclude 'dir2' src_directory/ dst_directory/	# Exclude Multiple Files or Directories
rsync -a --exclude={'file1.txt','dir1/*','dir2'} src_directory/ dst_directory/				# Exclude Multiple Files or Directories, bracket styles
