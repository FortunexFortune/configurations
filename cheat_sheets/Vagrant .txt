Vagrant is a virtual machine manager. It allows you to script the virtual machine 
configuration as well as the provisioning (scripts, Chef, Puppet, Ansible ).


Vagrant init              # initialize a vagrant environment by creating a vagrantfile
Vagrant up                # Creates and configure machine according to your Vagrantfile
Vagrant destroy           # used to destroy the environment 
Vagrant validate          # validates vagrant file
Vagrant provision         # runs any configured provisioners
Vagrant reload            #
Vagrant status            # returns the state of the machine
Vagrant ssh               # SSH into a vagrant box

Vagrant --version         # Returns vegrant version
