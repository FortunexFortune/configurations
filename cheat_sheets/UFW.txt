By default, UFW denies all incoming connections and allows all outgoing connections. 
It means that a client trying to reach our server would not be able to connect

sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status verbose

sudo ufw allow ssh                                  # To allow all incoming SSH connections
sudo ufw allow from 15.15.15.0/24  to any port 22   # Allow Incoming SSH from Specific IP Address or Subnet


sudo ufw allow http                                 # Allow Specific Incoming Connections
sudo ufw allow 80                                   # Allow Specific Incoming Connections



sudo ufw allow from 192.168.0.25 to any port 9000   # Allow request from specific ip

sudo ufw deny from 203.0.123.5                      #  Deny Incoming Connections
